Many recent analyses of the US film industry have commented on what seems to be a rapid increase in the number of sequels produced.[^1][^2] Lauren Duca is an example of this in her Huffington Post article, where she states “more than half of the top 25 highest-grossing films of 2014 were sequels, remakes or reboots”. With huge box office hits from the Star Wars and DC Franchises (who are continuing to make sequels in late 2017, recently releasing The Last Jedi and Justice League, respectively), this observation seems entirely reasonable. But in fact, the numbers tell a more interesting story surrounding the business of filmmaking, who occupies media space, and who is bringing in huge revenue.

The analysis of movies is more difficult than expected. Thousands and thousands of data are stored in the public IMDB database. After spending many hours scouring said database to determine what specifically would be defined as a sequel, a decision finally had to be made. We decided first that we were interested in more than strictly sequels. We wanted to explore the phenomenon that movies are less unique than they were in the past. In order to do so, we chose to look at movies defined as “Follows”, “Followed By”, “Remake of”, “Remade as”, “Version of”, and “Similar to” by IMDB. We discovered that between the years of 1955 and 2016, the percentage of sequels produced has actually been steadily decreasing and fell below 5% of movies in 2016. Surprisingly, during this same time, the percentage of total revenue for sequels was increasing. How can the percentage of sequels be decreasing while the revenue percentage is increasing? In short, an increase of indie movies that are not financially successful enough to create sequels are competing against major studio films that are finding that success.

Famed director Steven Spielberg recently helped to clear up the confusion of this discovery, stating that hollywood is “squeezing the middle class out of Hollywood and only allowing the $70m-plus films or the $10m-minus films [to be made].”[^3] After further research, we understood the reference he made to the rise of the independent film as the only alternative to major studio films. As the [average cost of studio films rises](http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-08/business/fi-40252_1_average-cost), individuals are having harder times pulling off the mid-budget movie (a kind of movie the studios want nothing to do with- they’d rather pay more money and take that risk in order to market to a larger audience). The middle is then thinned out, with more movies becoming lower-budgeted, independent films.

This research sheds light on the kind of oligopoly (an industry that is dominated by a few producers) that major film studios have over the movie market, and how that affects revenues. Former Paramount Studios producer and executive Robert Evans [notes himself](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/business/media/26scene.html) that the studios in power “are a mini-monopoly.”[^4] For example, in 2015, Disney and Universal pocketed almost 90% of the ticket sales through the year’s top 10 films and just this morning, Disney bought most of 21st Century Fox in a deal that “promises to reshape the media industry.”[^5][^6] This further suggests that mid-budget movies are getting weeded out and more and more indie films will instead be made. As this happens, these major films are then able to receive most of the box office revenue through their larger advertising budgets and marketing to worldwide audiences. Indie films, on the other hand, make significantly less. This could be the reason why, despite indie films being able to receive critical acclaim (like dominating awards such as the [Best Oscar Picture](http://m.imdb.com/chart/bestpicture/) in recent times), they are not in the running for best box office hits- they just don’t reach the same scale of audience.

Not only do these industries have the opportunity to create sequels, they see further profit in doing so. With the rise of algorithm and data use by these film giants comes the same result: “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” The major industries will almost always choose the safer option when it comes to creating a movie which usually means less variation between films equating to more sequels, remakes, and reboots and less big risks.[^7] This is because, as journalist Shane Snow puts it, “even though sequels usually make less money than their predecessors, they still make a lot more money than the average movie”. [^8]

Evidence suggests that streaming networks such as Amazon and Netflix may disrupt this pattern and change the game for independent films. Sean Fennessey for The Ringer [explains](https://www.theringer.com/2017/4/10/16044256/netflix-amazon-studios-independent-film-sundance-5def390a69ef) that certain independent filmmakers are finding lucrative success through deals with these networks. No longer do these directors have to go through the painstaking process of submitting materials to film festivals. Instead, they can simply sell their works to a streaming network and experience instant profit. Despite the melancholy some filmmakers feel about the change in venue for their work, many believe the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. This year, Sundance showed 119 films and forty-one have already been bought.[^9] If this trend continues, independent films will now have a new platform in which they can reach large-scale audiences, much like the major studio films have been doing for years. This change will allow these indie films to experience revenue increases unlike they have ever seen before, and alter the revenue percentage line within our graph. As the revenue for these indie films increase, the studio film sequels will not hold such an abnormal space within the market, which we will see in the decrease of our sequel revenue percentage line. This change should reflect the increase in proper competition within the movie film industry.

At this time, however, understanding the control of major studios over the film industry then allows our figure to actually make sense. The percentage of movies that are sequels declines as more and more indie films are made. The revenue percentage increases though, because those indie films cannot financially make sequels when they aren’t reaching the same audience or making the same revenues as major films. The major films have seen how profitable is is for themselves to make multiple sequels despite their costs, hence the surge of superhero worlds and book-adapted series mentioned earlier. Just like that, a graphic that initially seemed questionable is explained- the actual number of sequels declines as multitudes of indie producers do not have the means of creating them, while the big film companies capitalize on this subset of the market and make bank doing so, creating franchises that appeal to the masses.
